# Database Connection
# Before connecting to a MySQL database, make sure of the followings âˆ’

# You have created a database TESTDB.

# You have created a table EMPLOYEE in TESTDB.

# This table has fields FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, AGE, SEX and INCOME.

# User ID "testuser" and password "test123" are set to access TESTDB.

# Python module MySQLdb is installed properly on your machine.

# You have gone through MySQL tutorial to understand MySQL Basics.

# Example
# Following is the example of connecting with MySQL database "TESTDB"

#!/usr/bin/python

import MySQLdb

# Open database connection
db = MySQLdb.connect("localhost","testuser","test123","TESTDB" )

# prepare a cursor object using cursor() method
cursor = db.cursor()

# execute SQL query using execute() method.
